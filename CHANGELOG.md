# RxJava Disposable Leak Companion Changelog

## [Unreleased]

### Changed

- The rating prompt's local counter keeps one-way fingerprints of findings
  instead of their file paths, and deletes the list that earlier versions
  kept.
- `PRIVACY.md` describes the values the plugin keeps in the IDE's local
  settings.

## [0.1.1]

### Fixed

- Review/star CTA now links to this plugin's own Marketplace
  reviews page instead of the vendor's generic plugin list.

## [0.1.0]

### Added

- Warning icon on an RxJava subscribe(...) call whose returned
  Disposable is discarded as a bare expression statement -- there is
  no way to dispose of that subscription later, a well-documented
  source of memory/resource leaks.
- 100% static text/PSI analysis, Java and Kotlin, no network calls,
  no telemetry. Free.
