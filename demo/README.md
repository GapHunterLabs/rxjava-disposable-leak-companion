# Demo data — RxJava Disposable Leak Companion

For capturing the real Marketplace screenshot:

1. `./gradlew runIde`
2. Open `demo/OrderService.java` as a scratch/standalone file (or drop
   it into any sandbox project) inside the sandbox IDE.
3. The `orders.subscribe(...)` call inside `placeOrderUnsafely` shows
   the warning — hover it for the tooltip. `placeOrderSafely`'s
   variable-captured `Disposable` stays clean, for contrast.
4. Enter Full Screen (`View > Appearance > Enter Full Screen`), capture
   with `Win+Shift+S`, save directly to `docs/screenshots/` in this
   repo.
